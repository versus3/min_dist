1, Four datasets are generated everytime the data generator is run: 

tN.txt: keeps the dataset cardinalities. 
tC.txt: the client dataset.
tF.txt: the existing facility dataset.
tP.txt: the potential location dataset.

2, Dataset format:

id x0 x1 y0 y1

Here, id denotes the object ID. [x0, x1] and [y0, y1] denote the extents (the MBR) of the object on the x-dimension and the y-dimension, respectively. 
Since we assume data points, x0 == x1, y0 == y1.

Usage: 
(1) Open the project with Visual Studio (version 2005+).
(2) Compile and run the code on an exemplary dataset.
(3) Modify the experimental settings (use different datasets) in project settings to observe the code in various settings. In main.cpp, there is a switch (#define ADDING_QUERY/REPLACEMENT_QUERY) to control whether to run the location selection query or the facility replacement query algorithms and a switch (#define CREATENEW) to control the precomputatoin (compute dnn and create indexes on the datasets).
